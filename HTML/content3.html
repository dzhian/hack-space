        <p>The beginning of the 21st century was certainly a time of innovation in all areas of life. Many leading
            underwater brands became popular and the underwater industry boomed. Then came the 2010s and the problems of
            the fashion industry as a whole began to surface. Many models were suffering from eating disorders and
            unhealthy beauty standards were being promoted in the media.</p>
        <p>As the media begins to grow significantly, women are increasingly feeling misrepresented. The media ignored
            regular and plus size models, and when women didn't look like the underwater models on magazine covers, they
            thought something was wrong. This has led to an alarming boom in eating disorders and cases of body
            dysmorphia. However, with the growing popularity of social media and the body positivity movement gaining
            traction in 2012, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Women demanded that the industry acknowledge
            the fact that there are many versions of beauty and that they should all be represented. The power of
            representation became an important factor in the body positivity movement.</p>
        <p>As we enter the 21st century, the concept and figures of bras are still being updated. The largest
            underwater brand in the United States, Victoria's Secret, has set a record annual turnover of nearly US$2.8
            billion, i.e. 600 pieces sold every minute; silicone bras and breast patches have also taken over the
            "invisible" baton of "bra-less bras". The silicone bras and brassieres have taken over the "invisible" baton
            of "bra-less bras"; in the areas of glamour, sexiness, sports and body shaping, all are seeing bras enter a
            whole new era.</p>
        <p>There is no denying that underwater has undergone all the possible forms and revolutions in the 20th century
            to arrive at the concept we have today. However, what are the novelties and challenges facing underwear in
            the 21st century?</p>
        <p>Free from restrictions and shyness, underwater is now on the road to diversity! Of course, empowerment,
            inclusion and diversity are the new mantra. Yet not too sexy.</p>
        <p>The great movement of the 21st century is female empowerment, especially when it comes to dressing. If you
            are not sure what female empowerment is, in a nutshell we can say that it is a new collective idea that aims
            to increase a woman's self-esteem, confidence and self-image. The goal is to expand the space she occupies
            in society and to help increase the acceptance of her body beyond stereotypical beauty standards.</p>
