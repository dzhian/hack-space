        <p>In the 19th century, the corset underwear changed considerably, with metal rings for the eyelets and India
            rubber and plastic gradually replacing baleen as the material of support, making the corset softer and more
            comfortable and successfully moving away from the era of breathlessness.From the "female body as evil" of
            the Middle Ages to the tight undergarments and breast exposure of the Renaissance onwards.</p>
        <p>Behind every trend is a woman's desire to follow it. But who makes the rules of this so-called "beauty"?</p>
        <p>American feminist scholar Susan Brownmiller says: "Every method of glorifying a woman limits her freedom,
            makes her weak, and imbues her actions with artificial grace. It also convinces her that it all signals her
            superior status and more regulated moral demeanour.</p>
        <p>In the mid-19th century, the American New York-born Madame Bruma thought about the advancement of women in
            relation to women's clothing, advocating the liberation of women from long skirts that made movement
            difficult and corsets that were rigidly corseted. She had written an important page in the history of
            clothing development, as can be seen in the clothing of modern women. American women wore labour-friendly
            clothing and undergarments.</p>
        <p>In 1876, Abba Goold Woolson, the American godmother of female existentialism, said in an anti-girdling
            speech: "My primary role in existence is not that of a wife or a mother, but that of a woman, and I have the
            right to exist as a woman. I have the right to exist as a woman." Feminists claim that the corset has become
            an increasing obstacle to women's participation in society, especially in productive activities, and that
            this makes it impossible for women to adapt to modern society. In addition to this, medical research showed
            that corsets were too tight for women's health and that women should remove them to live more comfortably.
            In response to these calls, a dress reform movement emerged in the second half of the 19th century. This
            movement demanded that women should be able to be more productive and comfortable in their lives by reducing
            the constraints of flashy garments like the corset. Many women of the time loved this fashion, but they did
            suffer from it. As a result, more and more women, especially middle-class women, became involved in the
            dress reform movement. This movement contributed directly to the demise of the waist corset and by the 1910s
            it had receded and women's waist sizes had finally returned to a more physiologically healthy size.</p>
