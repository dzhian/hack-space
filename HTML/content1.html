            By the period 1200-1300, women's clothing began to become truly ornate - a great deal of gold, silver,
            pearls and precious stones were used in the design of clothing and luxury was at its height. During this
            period, women would wear a tight-fitting jacket that extended below the hips, which had long, tight sleeves
            and a seam around the wrist, fastened with elaborate buttons. Of course, women could also opt for another
            drape-like gown garment, which would have been trimmed with elaborate embroidery and animal furs. And the
            big difference from the last hundred years was that the women of the 13th century were finally free from the
            grip of the headscarf and completely liberated their hair. So too did a number of exquisite hairstyles -
            they began to braid their hair, hanging down the side of their faces to their necks, and decorating it with
            pearls, gold and silver ornaments.</p>
        <p>Since the Renaissance in the 15th century, women's quest for beauty was driven by the opening up of ideas to
            dress. They wore corsets on the top half of their bodies and women's skirts with wide hemlines on the bottom
            half. The corset was made of steel bars or whalebone. The baleen is cut into strips to support the garment;
            each corset has 40 or more baleen strips of varying length and thickness. Miraculously, the corset could
            cinch the waist from 19 inches to 14 inches.</p>
        <p>Between the 16th and 18th centuries, with the demise of the Roman Empire, corsets and corseted undergarments
            became prevalent. They were the kind we see in American and British dramas, where a maid would pull the
            straps at the back to tighten the waist and lift the breasts before wearing an evening gown, similar in
            shape to an hourglass, or what we call a "small waist + huge breasts", and the undergarments were so
            intricately designed that it could take hours to put one on. The underwater was also extremely intricate and
            could take hours to put on. It was all designed to suit the perverse aesthetics of men in those days, the
            same as the sexy "waist-to-hip ratio" that they are now known for.</p>
        <p>The period from the 15th to the early 18th centuries was a time of transition from traditional medieval to
            modern societies in Europe. The Renaissance, the Reformation and the technological revolution were among the
            major events that took place during this period. However, it was also during this period that a massive
            witch-hunt, a rare man-made disaster in Western history, took place across Europe. According to statistics,
            between 100,000 and 200,000 witches were put on trial during this witch-hunt, of whom between 50,000 and
            100,000 were executedÂ¹. Witches made up such a large proportion of the trials that many Western scholars see
            the witch hunts as a campaign of persecution against women. For example, the famous British witchcraft
            expert Lana argues that the so-called / witch hunts were a hunt for women. Another Western scholar has also
            pointed out that the massive witch hunts in Europe were a war against women waged by men. Others see the
            witch hunts as the first time in Western history that there was a systematic persecution of women.</p>
